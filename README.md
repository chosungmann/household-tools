## [`phototime.py`](./phototime.py/README.md)

`phototime.py` renames all photo files in a given directory to filenames that reflect the date and time when the photo was taken. It uses [`exiftool`](https://exiftool.org/) to determine the relevant metadata of the photo files, so make sure it is installed and accessible on your system.
